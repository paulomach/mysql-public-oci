## Ubuntu MySQL 8.0 OCI image

This is a fork of upstream's mysql image from https://github.com/docker-library/mysql

These are the main changes:
- using Ubuntu Focal 20.04 LTS as the layer
- installing MySQL 8.0 from Ubuntu Focal 12.04 LTS
- amd64 only at the moment

The entrypoint and environment variables were not changed.
